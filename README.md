# About
Spend less when traveling off-campus! Through this app, students with similar destinations can connect, find a time that works for everyone, and save money through sharing an Uber or Lyft. It’s as easy as posting a listing - say, to Ponce City Market or Atlanta Airport with a departure time - and waiting for responses, or responding to a listing yourself! Carpooling splits transportation costs and is environmentally friendly at the same time.

# Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 4, 2020

GT Travel ("GT Travel", "we", "us") understands the importance of your privacy as a user of this mobile application. We want you to understand how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you use GT Travel. To make this notice accessible, we have made it available on the login, signup, and the about section on the side menu in our mobile application. This privacy policy describes the types of information collected by GT Travel and how it is used.
#### PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES.

We only collect information that you provide to us directly with your consent when you use GT Travel. This includes:
1. Account information. To create an account, you must provide your name, Georgia Tech email, phone number, and password. None of your information will be public to other users unless you submit content to GT Travel (below). Your name, password, and phone number can be modified at any time as explained in the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Policy.
2. Content you submit. The content that you submit will be in the form of a listing that you want to make public to other users. This listing includes the destination, arrival time, and meeting location. By doing so, your name and phone number become public so that other users can contact you about making travel arrangements. 
We do not collect any information from you automatically. All information that we will collect is information that you are willing to provide.
## How We Use Information About You
We use information about you as required or permitted by law to:

## How Information About You Is Shared
We may share or disclose information in the following ways:
1. With Other Users: When you use GT Travel, certain information may be shared with other users with your consent. Again, the only information that will be shared to other users of the GT Travel will be when you decide to post a listing. Information that will become public to users will be the destination, arrival time, meeting location, and your name. Only when another user accepts your listing can you see their phone number, and they can see your phone number. In other words, your phone number will only be shared to those who accept your listing. Your email and password cannot be viewed, modified, or deleted by anyone but yourself.
2. Protection of GT Travel and Others: We may share or disclose certain information if we believe that it is necessary or appropriate to protect or defend the rights and safety of GT Travel or third parties, including to defend or enforce our Privacy Policy, our Terms and Conditions, or any other contractual arrangement.
3. With Your Consent: We also may share or disclose your information with your consent or at your discretion.
## Your choices
As a GT Travel user, you can protect and limit the amount of information that we collect, use, and share.
### Accessing and Changing Your Information
You can access and change certain personal information with the side menu. This feature displays all of your personal information, including your name, your phone number, and your email. The Edit Profile feature allows you to change your name and your phone number. To change your password, you can use the Forgot Password? feature on the login screen. Unfortunately we will not allow you to change your email, as this is a unique identifier for you as a user.
### Deleting Information
You may delete your account information at any time. To do so, please contact us with the information provided in the "Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy, and we will see to it that your account is permanently deleted from our system along with all of your unaccepted and accepted listings.

To delete a listing of yours that has not yet been accepted, there is a delete feature on all of your listings. Please tap that button at the top right to delete your listing.

To delete a listing that has already been accepted by another user, again please inform us of the listing that you want to have deleted by contacting us with the information provided in the "Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy.

## Data Security
We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access. Our Firebase Realtime Database security rules are written so that no one other than yourself has access to view, change, or delete your personal information or delete your personal and accepted listings. Our security rules also allow only people who use GT Travel to view your personal listings. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information. Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
## Data Storage
We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. If this app were shut down, then all data stored within our database will be deleted forever so that no one will have access to it again, including us. Before this happens, you will receive an email telling you that our app and our backend database will delete all of your personal information.
