## About
The goal of this app is to help students at the Georgia Institute of Technology spend less money when travelling off-campus. Students can connect with each other with this app about where they want to go and how they want to get there. For example, if John wanted to go to the Atlanta Airport tomorrow at 6:30 PM, then he can post their listing on this app and someone one else who also wants to go to the Atlanta Airport tomorrow at 6:30 PM can accept John's listing and contact him about transportation methods and costs. Carpooling can split the transportation costs and at the same time be environmentally friendly.

If you want to delete your account, change an accepted listing, or have any general questions about the app, contact me at amo9@gatech.edu.
